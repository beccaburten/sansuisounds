# sansuisounds

Welcome to **SansuiSounds**, where you can create, and listen to, your very own digital zen garden.   

## Background & Overview  

Visitors can place different sized stones and bonzai trees into a digital sandbox to design their garden, dragging and dropping the items from a bucket at the 
bottom of the screen. The sandbox and items will appear as a stylistic abstraction based on the ancient Japanese gardening style *Karesansui*.

Once satisfied with your design...it's time to rake! 
Press the play button at the bottom of the screen to watch as a five-toothed rake is pulled across the sandbox, creating fine lines in the 'sand' around your designs.
Upon encountering a stone or tree, the rake will instead draw a circle around the object, and continue on. 

Make sure you have your volume on-- these five-lined rakes are actually creating musical staves, and your stones have become the notes! You can listen to the 
soothing chimes of your own design as you watch your garden transform in the sand. 

When it hits the final note, you can play it again to enjoy your work, or clear the sand and start your new sansuisound-- no two are the same!
